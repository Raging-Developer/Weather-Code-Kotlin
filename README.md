# Weather-Code-Kotlin
Weather code for personal weather, written in Kotlin

I took a working app what I wrote and tried to remake it in Kotlin, with screens from Jetpack Composable. Maybe I should have started from scratch?

It works, just so long as you reload the app at least twice. I cannot get the data from the location listener and
the weather api to load into the Composable functions before the screens are loaded. I still think like a functional programme from my
CoBoL and C days. Which is ironic since Kotlin now uses functions without classes. I am also taking an app that works in Java and just
mirroring it in Kotlin. Using the old maxim, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Unfortunately that relies upon a given definition of 'broke'.
