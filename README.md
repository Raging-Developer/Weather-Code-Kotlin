# Weather-Code-Kotlin
Weather code for personal weather, written in Kotlin

I took a working app what I wrote and tried to remake it in Kotlin, with screens from Jetpack Compose and a ViewModel.

It works, I should not sound so surprised but kotlin is proving a challenge. I still think like a functional programme from my
CoBoL and C days. Which is ironic since Kotlin now uses functions without classes. I am also taking an app that works in Java and just
mirroring it in Kotlin. Using the old maxim, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Unfortunately that relies upon a given definition of 'broke'.
